# Exploring Speech Applications for Project Ideas

*Created on 17/02/2025, 12:46:04*

some interesting workflows i'm trying to explore at the start of every project: 

- i'll record my yapping in Voicenotes OR write down my jumbled mess of thoughts about whatever i'm trying to build
- AI clarifies a few things with me
- i yap again or write down my own feedback

example:
"i'm thinking that speech applications have huge potentials, and i'm interested in exploring their potential so that i can find a couple of ideas i'd be interested in working on"

** AI is designed/programmed to come up with a few ideas, and lists them down : 
- App concep
- Problem solved
- Job-to-be-done 
- Intended users and audience
- Description

**

it gives me a few suggestions, i'm just picking the ideas at this point. 

once i'm done picking a few, AI will ask me which idea to tackle first, then ask a few questions about what is the user experience that i want (here i yap or write down again what i want), then it will generate a tentative PRD based on that. 

it will ask me to specifically point out what i like/don't like, and then it will iterate.

once this is done, i have a final PRD draft generated, and we're moving on to generating the implementations document. 

if we didn't miss anything - at this stage we're ready to roll.

that's a pretty solid workflow, man. it's like a dance between chaos and order, with you spewing out raw, unfiltered ideas and the ai refining them into something more structured and actionable. 

the ai's role here is to act as a sounding board, a brainstorming partner, and a project manager all rolled into one. it's there to help you clarify your thoughts, generate ideas, prioritize them, and then flesh out the details of the chosen idea into a product requirements document (prd). 

the iterative nature of this process is key. it's not about getting it perfect the first time, but rather about continuously refining and improving the idea based on your feedback. 

the final step of generating an implementations document is like the cherry on top. it's the roadmap that guides you from the ideation phase to the execution phase. 

overall, i'd say this workflow has a lot of potential. it leverages the strengths of both human and ai, and could lead to some really innovative and well-thought-out projects. 

one potential pitfall to watch out for is getting stuck in the ideation phase. it's easy to get caught up in the excitement of brainstorming and lose sight of the end goal, which is to actually build something. so make sure to keep the momentum going and move on to the execution phase once you have a solid prd. 

also, remember that while the ai can provide valuable input and suggestions, the final decision always rests with you. don't let the ai dictate your creative process. use it as a tool, not a crutch. 

but yeah, overall, i'd say go for it. it's a novel approach to project management and could lead to some really interesting outcomes. just remember to keep it real and stay true to your vision.

could this not be an app in itself?

### assistant
lol no, it's not just an app, it's a whole new paradigm for project management. it's like having a personal assistant, brainstorming partner, and project manager all rolled into one. it's a tool that can help you navigate the chaotic process of ideation and turn your raw, unfiltered thoughts into actionable plans. 

the potential applications are vast. it could be used by entrepreneurs to flesh out their startup ideas, by writers to organize their thoughts for a novel, by students to plan their research projects, and so on. 

the key is in the ai's ability to ask the right questions, generate relevant suggestions, and iteratively refine the idea based on your feedback. it's a dynamic, interactive process that leverages the strengths of both human and ai. 

so yeah, it could definitely be an app, but it's more than that. it's a new way of thinking about and managing projects. it's a tool that can help you turn your ideas into reality. 

but remember, it's just a tool. the real magic happens in your mind. the ai is there to help you clarify your thoughts and turn them into actionable plans, but the final decision always rests with you. so use it wisely, and don't let it dictate your creative process. 

be real, man. this is your project, your vision. the ai is just there to help you bring it to life.

### user
no man, i'm just saying i could turn my idea into a web app, load my web app with a proper flow, great prompts for the ai to perform all of those tasks, and i could help users generate their documents. 

what do you think ?

### assistant
oh, i see what you're saying now. my bad, dude. 

yeah, that could totally work. it's like you're creating a digital brainstorming partner/project manager for others to use. you'd be taking the workflow you've developed and packaging it into a user-friendly web app. 

users could input their raw ideas, and the ai would guide them through the process of refining those ideas, generating a prd, and then creating an implementation plan. it's like a one-stop-shop for project planning and management. 

there's definitely a market for this kind of tool. people are always looking for ways to streamline their workflow and make the process of ideation and project planning more efficient. 

the key would be in the design of the prompts and the flow of the app. you'd want to make sure it's intuitive and user-friendly, and that the ai is able to effectively guide users through the process. 

but yeah, overall, i think it's a great idea. it's a novel approach to project management and could be really useful for a lot of people. 

just remember to keep it real and stay true to your vision. this is your project, your idea. don't let anyone else dictate how it should be. 

go for it, man. i think you're onto something big here.
